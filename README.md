# CDL Journal Transfer Application

A small Python 3 CLI application to handle the transfer of journal data to and from OJS and Janeway.

## Installation

This module requires Python 3. It comes preinstalled on my modern systems, but if not you can
download it at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Clone this repo and navigate to it. Install dependencies with `bin/install`.

## Usage

CLI commands can be executed with:

```shell
bin/cdl-jt <COMMAND>
```

or

```shell
python -m cdl_journal_transfer <COMMAND>
```

Note: If you use the latter syntax and invoke python directly, you'll likely want to activate the virtual environment first with `source ./venv/bin/activate`. `bin/cdl-jt` does this for you.

### Use

TODO: copy/paste finalized help here

All commands are described by invoking `bin/cdl-jt --help`. Detail on individual commands can be viewed with `bin/cdl-jt <COMMAND> --help`.
